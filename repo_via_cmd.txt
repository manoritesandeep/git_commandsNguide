#### Create a new repository from the COMMAND LINE

To create a new repository from the command line, you can follow these steps:

    Open your terminal or command prompt.

    Navigate to the folder where you want to create the repository using the cd command.

    Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:

    git init

    Create a new repository on GitHub by running the following command:

    gh repo create

    This command will prompt you to enter a repository name, description, and other options. You can follow the instructions in the command line interface to provide the necessary information.

    Once you've provided the required information, the command will create a new repository on GitHub and set it as the remote repository for your local Git repository.

    You can now add your files to the repository using the git add command and commit your changes using the git commit command.

    Finally, you can push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub using the git push command:

    git push origin master

    Note: Replace origin with the name of your remote repository if you have set a different name.

That's it! You have successfully created a new repository from the command line and pushed your files to GitHub.
