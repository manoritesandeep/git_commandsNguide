Please note that changing the default branch name on GitHub does not automatically update the branch names in your local Git repository. 
If you want to update the branch name in your local repository, you can follow these steps:

    Open your terminal or command prompt.

    Navigate to the local repository directory using the cd command.

    Run the following command to rename the current branch to "main":

    git branch -m master main

    Update the upstream branch reference to "main" using the following command:

    git push -u origin main

    This command will push the renamed branch to the remote repository and set it as the upstream branch.

After completing these steps, your local repository will use "main" as the default branch name, and the remote repository on GitHub will also have "main" as the default branch.

Thank you :)
